            As a lover of math and computer science, my dream is to improve society through algorithms and
            computational innovation. I'm also very interested in software development, machine learning, and AI.

            Outside of tech, I'm a very avid language learner. I'm fluent in English, Mandarin, and French â€”
            I am currently working on mastering Spanish. One of my life goals is to become a polyglot and be
            able to communicate with people all over the world.

            In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, going to the gym, and kicking back to classic mobster films.
